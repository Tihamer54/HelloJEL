# HelloJEL
A Hello World for the Java Expressions Library

This project contains two classes needed for a "Hello World" (mavenized) Eclipse project of the Java Expressions Library 
that was created by Konstantin L. Metlov <metlov@fti.dn.ua>.
The main method in the JavaEvaluator class contains a few examples.

TODO: While I have mavenized this project (in addition to providing examples that work after you've updated your local Maven repo), 
at the time of this first commit, mvnrepository.com only has the 2.0.1 version, 
while the version at https://www.gnu.org/software/jel/ is up to 2.1.1.
